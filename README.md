Exercise
Register on GitHub and create a new account, if you do not already have a GitHub account.
Create a new GitHub repository with the Name 'zemoso-campus-training'. Add appropriate 'README.md' and '.gitignore' files to this repository.
Create a new branch called 'develop'
On the 'develop' branch create a new folder called 'week-0'. Inside the folder add a file containing the program described below.
Program Description : Write a program (in any programming language of your choice) which reads an integer 'n' from stdin and print all the primes less than that integer. (1 <= n <= 100).
Create a pull request to merge the develop branch with the master branch.
Submit the link to the pull request in an email.

# WEEK 1 
Week 1 : Introduction to Style Guide and CS 50 [Scratch, C]
Learning Material
Go through the following sections in Week 0 of CS 50
--Video Lecture
--Notes

Algorithmic Complexity, Data Representation and Pseudo Code are important topics that must be made a note of while going through the above material.
Next Go through the following sections in Week 1 of CS 50
--Video Lecture
--Notes
--Slides
--Problem Set 1
This lecture introduces to C programming (Which is a low level language) apart from this it also explains a few important fundamental programming concepts applicable in most programming languages. Go through the problem set, you could try working through them in CS 50 sandbox environment. The solutions to the problem Set are provided on Week 1 main page, take a look at them once you are done.

Style Guide

Following are the Style Guides we will be adopting through out our course. Understand that the choice of style Guide depends very much on the type of Project that is being developed. The reasoning behind the choices below is to introduce you to a general industry wide standard.

C++      : Google
C        : CS 50
Python   : PEP 8
Java     : Twitter

Before you make a submission, Make sure you are adhering to the style guide of that language.

Exercise
On the 'develop' branch create a new folder called 'week-1'. Inside the folder add a file containing the program described below.
Program Description : Write a program (in any programming language of your choice) which reads number of units of energy consumed from stdin and prints the electricity bill calculated as per below conditions.
For the first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit
