The sieve of eratosthenes, is one the best algorithms for finding prime numbers smaller than or equal to n. 
It has a time complexity of O(n*log(log(n))).

But since our recommended domain of n is 1<= n <=100, hence we can directly print out all the prime numbers 
that are smaller than n using simple conditional statements. That would be a much better approach.
